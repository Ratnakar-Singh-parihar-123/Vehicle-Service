# Favicon Placeholder

Since we can't create a binary .ico file through text, you have a few options:

## Option 1: Use an online favicon generator
1. Go to https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/
2. Create a simple icon with "VS" text (Vehicle Service)
3. Download the favicon.ico file
4. Place it in client/public/favicon.ico

## Option 2: Use the SVG favicon (modern browsers)
The favicon.svg we created will work in modern browsers.
The 404 error for favicon.ico will still appear in older browsers.

## Option 3: Copy from another project
If you have another React project, copy its favicon.ico file.

## Option 4: Use a simple 16x16 PNG renamed to .ico
Create a simple 16x16 pixel PNG image and rename it to favicon.ico.
Most browsers will accept this.

For now, the SVG favicon will work in modern browsers, and the 404 error
for favicon.ico is not critical - it won't break your application.
