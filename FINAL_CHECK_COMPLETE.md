# ✅ Final Check Complete - All Issues Resolved

## 🔧 **Issue Found & Fixed**

### **🚨 Critical Issue Identified:**
**Problem**: Syntax error in Home.js - malformed className attribute
```javascript
// BROKEN (from manual edit):
<span text-black> Sign In</span>

// FIXED:
Sign In
```

### **🛠️ What Was Wrong:**
1. **Missing `className=`**: The `text-black` was missing the `className=` attribute
2. **CSS Conflict**: The button had `text-white` class but span had `text-black` class
3. **Hover Conflict**: Button has `hover:text-primary-600` which would conflict with span's `text-black`

### **✅ Solution Applied:**
- Removed the problematic span with conflicting classes
- Kept the original clean button structure
- Maintained proper CSS hierarchy and hover states
